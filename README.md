## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

For now I will be focusing to make changes to the UI as the current UI is not attractive at all
Then during the uploading I am also planning to add a progressbar to show users the progress of their upload
Also at very few places the data is not very persistent so I have plans to rectify that too
